Omar — Full-Stack Web Developer Portfolio

Tech Stack:

Frontend Framework: React (Vite)

Styling: Tailwind CSS (or CSS Modules if specified later)

Animations: Smooth scrolling + light motion

Assets: I will provide images for each section and each component

Behavior: Fully responsive (desktop → mobile)

📄 GENERAL DESCRIPTION

This is a one-page portfolio website built in React.

The website is divided vertically into five main sections, each occupying 100% of the viewport height (100vh).
Navigation between sections must be smooth, fluid, and uninterrupted.

Sections (from top to bottom)

Navbar (sticky, not 100vh)

About (100vh)

Services (100vh)

Projects (100vh)

Contact (100vh)

Footer (100vh)

Total: 5 full-height sections + sticky navbar.

🧠 AI AGENT RULES (MUST FOLLOW EXACTLY)

Follow the layout shown in the images I will provide

For each section, I will send design images.

You must reproduce exactly the structure, layout, spacing, typography, and colors.

Each main section = full height (100vh)
The final result must look like 5 consecutive fullscreen panels stacked vertically.

Smooth scrolling must be implemented

Native CSS scroll-behavior: smooth, or

react-scroll if needed.

Navbar is sticky and links scroll to their sections

About → scroll to About

Services → scroll to Services

Projects → scroll to Projects

Contact → scroll to Contact

Footer → scroll to footer
